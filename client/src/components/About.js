      <h1>About Drug It</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Drug It! Our hackathon project is designed to help travelers communicate their medical needs and get the appropriate treatment when visiting a foreign country. With our platform, you can easily translate medicine names into the local language, making it easier to communicate with healthcare professionals and obtain the necessary medications.</p>
      <p>In addition to our medicine translation feature, we also included a built-in translator on our website. This allows users to ask healthcare professionals questions and describe their conditions in their own language, which will then be automatically translated into the local language.</p>
      <p>We are excited to offer this valuable resource to travelers and hope it makes a positive difference in their medical experiences while abroad. Thank you for choosing Drug It and we hope it serves you well on your travels.</p>
